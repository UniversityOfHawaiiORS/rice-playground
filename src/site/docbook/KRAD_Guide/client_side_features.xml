                    <para>The content that is not displayed initially is associated with a

                    <para>In KRAD we can configure a component to be progressive disclosed by
                        setting the <emphasis role="bold">progressiveRender</emphasis> property

                    <para>The value for the progressive render property is an el statement. However
                        only a subset of the EL is supported since the expression will be translated
                        to script that evaluates on the client. Therefore for the most part the
                        expressions are restricted to evaluation of model properties with a subset
                        of the EL operators </para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>First evaluation is done on the initial request to determine if the
                        content should be displayed. In order to be initially displayed both the
                        render property (which can be an expression) and the progressiveRender
                        property must evaluate to true </para>

                    <para>If the evaluation succeeds and the content is hidden, it will be shown.

                                <para>default (no other flags set) – content will be sent to the

                                    visible </para>

                                <para>progressiveRenderViaAJAX set to true – if this property of
                                    Component is set to true and the component’s progressive render

                                    the client. When the condition becomes true on the client, a
                                    request with AJAX will be made to retrieve the content. Once the
                                    content is retrieve the first time it remains in the client for

    <title>Data Attributes</title>
    <listitem>
      <para>HTML 5 data attributes are a way of adding custom attributes to tags. Data attributes are prefixed with
        a &apos;data-&apos; prefix e.g &apos;data-role&apos;. JQuery makes data attributes available on the jQuery data object for use
        in scripting manipulations.
        Internally, KRAD uses the jQuery data object and data attributes heavily in validation amongst other uses.
        This can be seen in krad.validate.js.</para>
      <para>Data attributes are available on all form elements except the radio button.
        Page elements like image, iframe and links also support data attributes. There are two ways to add data attributes to
        a control or element. Both these ways involve setting properties in the defining XML configuration files. </para>
      <para>The first way applies to three data attributes which can be set directly on a component using the property names
        data-role, data-meta and data-type. These attributes are physically present on the tag for the component on
        which they have been configured. This can be seen in lines 13 - 15 of the program listing below.
      </para>
      <para>The second way is to use the dataAttributes map to set a list of attributes.
        The map key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value.
        Using the map is appropriate when complex attributes need to be set. Complex attributes are those whose values contain
        &apos;{}&apos;. Data attributes set via this map are not physically present on the tag but are set on the components jQuery
      data object via an initialization script that runs on page load. This can be seen in lines 5 - 12 of the program listing below.</para>
      <para></para>
      <para>A sample configuration is shown below.</para>

            <title>Client Side Validation </title>
            <para>Client-side validation refers to validation that happens without interaction with
                the server, immediately during user interaction with input fields. Client-side
                validation uses the constraints defined on InputFields and AttributeDefinitions to
                determine if a field is valid. These constraints are converted in the java code to
                methods and rules used by the jquery.validate.js plugin. </para>
            <para>When the user has interacted with a field and moved on to the next field,
                client-side validation is invoked on that field and any validation errors are shown
                on the screen. When the user goes back to a field to correct it, validation occurs
                with any change so the user gets immediate feedback on if they fixed their error. </para>
            <para> The validation messages shown are determined by the labelKey on the constraint
                for that field. </para>
            <para>By default, client-side validation is on. Client-side validation can be turned
                off/on on each individual constraint, but also at the FormView level through the
                validateClientSide flag. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title> Server Side Validation </title>
            <para>KRAD enabled server-side validation must be performed manually through methods on
                your custom controller. To call server validation manually, use the validateView
                method on the ViewValidationService. This method will validate on any constraints
                set on the InputFields/AttributeDefinitions for your view. If there are any errors,
                this method will add them to the messageMap. The validation mechanism used is
                functionally equivalent to client-side validation. </para>
            <para> KRADServiceLocatorWeb.getViewValidationService().validateView(form); </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Validation Messages </title>
            <para>ValidationMessages configurations are defined by default on the Page, Group, and
                Fields of a View. The ValidationMessages component contains settings related to how
                messages are displayed. Various flags for displaying errors, warnings, and
                information contained in the MessageMap are controlled through ValidationMessages
                component configuration. These settings currently only control the display of
                messages that are sent back from the server, client-side validation error messages
                are always displayed in the appropriate location next to the field. </para>
            <para>The additionalKeysToMatch property takes in a list of keys to match on in the
                MessageMap, which will be displayed with the Page/Group/Field’s messages, if
                present. By default, pages and groups will automatically match on all their nested
                fields using their propertyPaths as keys. To display a message on a field, add it to
                the MessageMap using that field’s property path as a key. </para>
            <para>Display flags control if certain type of messages (or all messages are displayed).
                The displayCounts flag determines if the number of messages is displayed for each
                type. The property displayErrorTitle (and other similar flags) determines if the
                errorTitle (and other similar properties) for the messages div is displayed. </para>
            <para>Two flags that also affect client-side validation display are highlightOnError
                (control if the field is highlighted when it has an error) and displayFieldErrorIcon
                (controls if the field displays a small icon next to it when it has an error). </para>
            <para>Note that the bean is called Uif-ValidationMessages and the underlying class is
                called ErrorsField (ErrorsField name to be changed to match in a future update,
                along with various other changes in this area). </para>
            <tip><para><emphasis role="bold">Validation Messages:</emphasis> Messages that are unrelated to
                    constraints can also be _ sent back through the MessageMap generated by your own
                    logic in your controller methods. These messages will be shown alongside any
                    others in the MessageMap.</para></tip>
