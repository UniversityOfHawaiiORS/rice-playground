<!-- This is a sample of the common config file included by all unit tests.
     Copy this file into your home directory under kuali/test/dev/common-test-config.xml, and change the
     datasource settings for your unit test datasource (don't forget this db needs the rice_test.sql table
     in it in order for unit tests to run).
